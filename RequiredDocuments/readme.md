Purpose: Codenames for ICS4U1 Final CPT

How to play:
Teams: 
Form two teams, each with one Spymaster and one or more Operatives

Goal: 
Each team's Spymaster gives one-word clues with a number to help their team's Operatives identify all of their assigned colored words from the 5x5 grid first.

Turns:
The Spymaster says a single-word clue and a number (e.g., "Ocean, 3").

Operatives discuss and click on one word they think matches the clue. They can guess up to the number given plus one.

Guessing correctly allows the team to continue guessing; guessing a neutral bystander or an opponent's card ends the turn.

Guessing the assassin (black card) results in an immediate loss for that team.

Winning: 
The first team to correctly identify all of their words wins, unless they guess the assassin word.
